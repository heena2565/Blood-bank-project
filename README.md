Blood Bank Management System
    A Blood Donation Online Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and simplify the process of blood donation and management. This system leverages technology to bridge the gap between blood donors, blood banks, and those in need of blood.

   Blood donors can register online, providing essential information such as their blood type, contact details, and availability for donation. This simplifies the process for both donors and blood banks.

    
Donors can schedule blood donation appointments, reducing waiting times and making it more convenient for both donors and blood banks.
